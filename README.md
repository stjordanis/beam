Things that make BEAM special include:

* Users have complete control over privacy - a user decides which information will be available and to which parties, having complete control over his personal data in accordance to his will and applicable laws.
* Confidentiality without penalty - in BEAM confidential transactions do not cause bloating of the blockchain, avoiding excessive computational overhead or penalty on performance or scalability while completely concealing the transaction value.
* No trusted setup required
* Blocks are mined using Equihash Proof-of-Work algorithm.
* Limited emission using periodic halving.
* No addresses are stored in the blockchain - no information whatsoever about either the sender or the receiver of a transaction is stored in the blockchain.
* Superior scalability through compact blockchain size - using the “cut-through” feature of
Mimblewimble makes the BEAM blockchain orders of magnitude smaller than any other
blockchain implementation.
* BEAM supports many transaction types such as escrow transactions, time locked
transactions, atomic swaps and more.
* No premine. No ICO. Backed by a treasury, emitted from every block during the first five
years.
* Implemented from scratch in C++.

# Roadmap

- March 2018     : Project started
- June 2018       : Internal POC featuring fully functional node and CLI wallet
- September 2018 : Testnet 1 and Graphical Wallet
- December 2018  : Mainnet launch

# Current status

- Fully functional wallet with key generator and storage supporting secure and confidential online transactions.
- Full node with both transaction and block validation and full UTXO state management.
- Equihash miner with periodic mining difficulty adjustment.
- Batch Bulletproofs, the efficient non-interactive zero knowledge range proofs now in batch mode
- Graphical Wallet Application for Linux, Mac and Windows platforms
- Offline transactions using Secure BBS system
- ChainWork - sublinear blockchain validation, based on FlyClient idea by Loi Luu, Benedikt Bünz, Mahdi Zamani
- Compact history using cut through
